    <p>The event hosting landscape has changed considerably for everyone, but particularly for creative events agencies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the restrictions placed on physical interactions, social events had been halted. Most events were introduced as online event solutions, wherein attendees could attend via social media platforms.
    <br>However, now, there are unique and safe ways to host socially distant events physically. Though no physical event can be entirely risk-free, if you follow the right precautions, you can maximize the safety of your guests while keeping them entertained. In this guide, we will be showing you how you can do just that. 
    <h2>Considerations for Socially Distant Events</h2>
    <p>If you are planning to host your first socially distant event, whether it is a work conference, an outdoor market, or a concert, there are some factors you must consider to ensure social distancing rules are met, and your event is memorable. Let’s take a look at what these are.<br>
        <br><h3>1.Take a Look at Your Local Area and CDC Recommendations</h3>
    <br>
    Creative events agencies and event holders are responsible for ensuring their guests’ safety, especially during these unprecedented times. Hence this consideration should not go unnoticed. Here are some tips to follow when looking through the CDC recommendations include: 
    <ul>
        <li>Remember that these regulations keep changing frequently, so you will need to keep checking and stay updated with their guidelines on social gatherings </li>
        <li>Take some time to look through these regulations as that will save you money, time, and resources</li>
        <li>Stay open to changes in your budget and planning because of the changing regulations</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>2.Consider Hosting Your Event Outdoors</h3>
    choosing an event venue and hosting a socially distanced event will be much easier when you do it outdoors rather than in enclosed spaces, as there are stricter rules to follow when you do the latter. If possible, when geographical location and weather conditions comply, you should shift your event outdoors. After online event solutions on virtual platforms, who wouldn’t want to attend an event in the open, fresh air? 
    <br><br>
    <h3>3.Limit the Number of Attendees</h3>
    <br>
    This one’s a no-brainer, but in light of the pandemic when risks are at an all-time high, you should try to reduce the number of attendees as much as you can. The higher the number of attendees there are, the greater the risk of spread of the disease. Be realistic about the maximum number of people that can attend your event, and stick to this number. Perhaps you can consider hosting a portion of your attendees virtually instead of having them physically appear. 
    <br><br>
    <h3>4.Be Creative</h3>
     <p>In these times, virtual event management companies pushed their boundaries to produce creative and engaging online gatherings and events. Similarly, you must get creative and curate an event unique from the traditional events and follow the appropriate guidelines. For example, drive-in events have been quite popular as they are a safe way of entertaining guests, whether at a concert, theatre, or conference.
    </p><br>
<h3>5.Include A Virtual Component</h3><br>

There are several unique and creative ways to make your event partially virtual. Incorporating a virtual component, such as through Zoom or live coverage on social media platforms, can help increase your event’s outreach. It will also allow individuals who live far to be in attendance. 
<br><br>
<h3>6.Implement Social Distancing Measures</h3><br>
To achieve an event that is not just entertaining and successful is not enough. You have to maximize the safety of your guests, and this can be done by creating and implementing thorough social distancing measures. Some of the ways you can do this are by:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Reviewing your event location and analyzing if it is in accordance with CDC guidelines and social distancing measures</li>
    <li>Incorporating these measures in your budget; these will cost you money, for example, when you buy hand sanitizers, masks, gloves, cleaning supplies, etc.
        Move the ticketing process online so that there is no physical exchange of money</li>
    <li>Communicate The Safety Measures</li>
    <li>This is a crucial factor to consider. You must communicate all your safety measures to your attendees either on the ticket, event page, email or website. Your number one priority is your attendees’ safety, and this should be communicated to them. Inform them about these measures and why you are keeping them, and they will be much more empathetic and likely to follow them. </li>
</ul><br>
<h3>7.Incorporate Technology </h3>
<br>
In this day and age, you will need to incorporate technology to some extent for a safe and successful socially distanced event. This is where virtual event management companies can be of significant help. They can provide you with different ways to make aspects of your event virtual inexpensive, such as ticketing, scanning of tickets through mobile apps, tracking guests, and much more. 
<br><br>
<h3>8.Be Flexible</h3> <br>
 The last consideration to keep in mind when hosting a socially distanced event is that as the event host, you have to be flexible at all times. As we mentioned earlier, the CDC recommendations will be continually changing, and you will need to adapt quickly to them. Today’s events are unlike the traditional ones, so you must remember that you will need to be flexible and adaptive in order to make your event successful.
