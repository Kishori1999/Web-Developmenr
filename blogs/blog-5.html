            <p> Have you ever attended an event and then asked yourself why you choose that event over another?
                <br>
                Or, have you wondered what it takes to get event attendees to buy tickets to your event?
                <br>
                That’s where event psychology comes in.
                <br>
                It’s a relatively new area of study in the event world and…
                <br>
                Simply put, it’s the understanding of people’s behaviour and experience. Basically, what is the
                attendee’s attitude toward your event?
                <br>
                Understanding event psychology helps us better understand the audience we’re attracting, what they like
                or dislike and what motivates them to attend an event.
                <br>
                Purposefully using these techniques is a smart marketing tool that is under-utilized in the event
                industry. Yet, it shows event planners how guests think and feel about an event, what motivates them and
                helps us know how people process our marketing and communication pieces.
                <br>
                By using the element of surprise and introducing something unexpected, you’re able to identify what
                makes people part of a group and how they feel connected to that group. Attendees are drawn to events
                that make them happy, make them smile or feel something that excites them.
                <br>
                This increases product, service and ticket sales.

                    <li>What is event psychology and why is it important to you as an event planner?</li>

                Events are a great resource to learn how attendees behave, communicate and make decisions, and using
                event psychology shows you how these interactions are at the heart of the event.
                <br>
                Combining science and events helps create positive experiences because knowing why people buy tickets,
                for example, how people learn, what makes communication easier between people and why people choose an
                event over another.
                <br>
                You don’t have to be an event psychologist to understand that it plays an important role in your events
                and that your attendees are collecting small amounts of data throughout the event to draw an overall
                conclusion about its impact on them.
